/// Domain Builder
///
/// Loading a domain isn't that complicated really: there's currently only a
/// single  file type from which to load one. Although, that _is_ going to
/// change once `Nutter` is running. The main reason for a builder is so that we
/// can affect the instances in the domain in a single convenient place.
///
/// There are two opportunities to insert (there is no removal mechanism in the
/// [`ObjectStore`][os] interface, and maybe that needs to be addressed) instances
/// into the store. Before extrusion, and after extrusion. Remember that extrusion
/// is the means by which instances in `nut::sarzak::ObjectStore` are converted
/// to instances in `sarzak::sarzak::ObjectStore`.
///
/// # Pre-extrusion
///
/// Pre-extrusion modification is necessary for base functionality in order to
/// pre-populate the store with primitives that we need in the store during
/// extrusion. For example, when extruding [`Attribute`] we need to be able to
/// point at an instance of [`Type`]. Type however consists of `const` `Uuid`s,
/// which don't yet exist in the new store. So we create them before doing
/// extrusion.
///
/// ```
/// # use sarzak::sarzak::{Cardinality, ONE, MANY};
/// # use sarzak::domain::DomainBuilder;
/// # const SARZAK_MODEL:&str = "models/sarzak.json";
/// let sarzak = DomainBuilder::new()
///     .cuckoo_model(SARZAK_MODEL).unwrap()
///     .pre_extrude(|mut sarzak, mut drawing| {
///         // Create instances of primitives missing from nut::sarzak that
///         // the extrusion process depends upon.
///         sarzak.inter_cardinality(Cardinality::One(ONE));
///         sarzak.inter_cardinality(Cardinality::Many(MANY));
///     })
///     .build().unwrap();
///
/// let store = sarzak.get_sarzak();
/// assert_eq!(&Cardinality::One(ONE), store.exhume_cardinality(&ONE).unwrap())
///```
///
/// I think that pre-extrusion is not going to be generally interesting. I think
/// that the generally interesting functionality is going to be post-extrusion.
/// It is during post-extrusion that one has the opportunity to create instances
/// that don't exist in the source model. This has two applications.
///
/// # Post-extrusion
///
/// When loading the metamodel we have the opportunity to create instances of
/// [`State`][s] and it's related objects. This is significant because we don't
/// yet have a tool for creating states and [`Event`][e]s and whatnot. This is
/// a gateway to allow us to start working on action semantics without needing
/// a tool.
///
/// When loading an application domain post-extrusion allows one to initialize
/// the system with instances that should exist at start-up. It's also a place
/// where initialization events may be created and sent.

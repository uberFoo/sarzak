Sarzak is a tool that I'm building for myself.
The proximate goal is 100% generated code[^gen].
The ultimate goal is to blink an LED.

[^gen]:
    Clearly the word "generated" needs definition. When I say it, what I
    mean is that when the compiler builds sarzak, it's building code that was
    generated by sarzak. Somewhere back in time, there will have been handwritten
    code, but that will be phased out as the compiler progresses. Now, code
    written in the DSL doesn't count as handwritten. That's because what's
    written in the DSL will eventually be generated. The idea is that if I
    cared to do so, I could build a C++ code generator, and compile C++.

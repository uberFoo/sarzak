# Introduction

Sarzak is a tool that I'm building for myself — using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org), a really *Good Language*[^rust].
It's a tool that let's you draw a model of a software system, and translates it into code.

This idea is far from a new one.
A few decades ago I worked for a company called [Project Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlaer–Mellor_method)[^dog].
They sold consulting services and software tools centered around code generation for embedded targets.
I worked on the software tools, specifically the _Model Compilers_, which did the code translation.
This effort is essentially a re-imagining of what we did at PT over 20 years ago.

The proximate goal of this project is 100% generated code[^gen].
The ultimate goal is to blink an LED[^blink].

This book will first introduce the reader to the methodology used to translate models to code.
It will then take a trip through the design and implementation of the current implementation.
It is expected that this book will be updated as the project progresses.

[^rust]: Rust has a lot going for it.
It's compiled, so it's close to the metal.
It's efficient along axes that I care about (speed, use only what you need, etc.).
It *smells* functional in a lot of good ways.
It has *nice things*, like [crates](https://crates.io), [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) and [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/), just to mention a few.

[^dog]: Sarzak was Stephen and Sally's dog, and also the name of one of the main servers at the company.

[^gen]: Clearly the word "generated" requires definition.
When I use it, what I mean is that when the compiler builds sarzak, it's building code that was generated by sarzak.
Somewhere back in time, there will have been handwritten code, but that will be phased out as the compiler progresses.
Now, code written in the Domain Specific Language (DSL) doesn't count as handwritten.
That's because what's written in the DSL will eventually be translated, and generated.
The idea is that if I cared to do so, I could build a C++ code generator, and compile C++.
Since none of this is written in C++, the result would indeed be 100% generated.

[^blink]: I started this because I waned to get back into programming micro-controllers using Rust.
With me, nothing is straightforward.

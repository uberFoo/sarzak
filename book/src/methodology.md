# Methodology

One cannot expect to turn a model into code, without some set of rules about what the model means.
I'm using a hybrid [Shlaer-Mellor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlaerâ€“Mellor_method) method, which was developed back in the the 1980's and 1990's.
I say hybrid because while I try to hew true to what's described in the books @@purple-book @@green-book, in the end needs to work for me.

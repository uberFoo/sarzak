@book{purple-book,
  abstract      = {This practical, how-to book lays the groundwork for an object-oriented approach to systems development through information modeling, a powerful technique for systems analysis. The approach focuses on identification, formalization, and verification of expert knowledge from diverse business, engineering, and technical disciplines as a means of determining teh intrinsic information requirements of the system. The technique is appropriate for rich and complex problem environments (real-time control systems, decision support systems, or knowledge-based systems), as well as for straightforward applications with minimal processing requirements (database problems, for example).},

It is designed to produce a comprehensive and understandable model of a solution independent of the organization of the software implementation. It is a highly abstract thinking tool that aids in the formalizaiton of knowledge, and is also a way of describing the concepts that make up abstract solutions to software development problems.},

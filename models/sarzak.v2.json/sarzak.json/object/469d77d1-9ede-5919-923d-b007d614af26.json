  "description": "A `Relationship` indicates that a set of objects are connected to each other in some manner. Typically it is a _real world_ relationship. In the \ncase of this model it is strictly an abstraction.\n\nThere are three types of `Relationship`: [`Isa`], [`Binary`], and [`Associative`]. Thus `Relationship` is itself the *supertype* in an [`Isa`] relationship. It is a partitioning *supertype-subtype* relationship, rather one of inheritance. As such, it’s  perfectly suited to a rust `enum`! 😃",

    "description": "A Block Expression\n\nA block expression is an expression that consists of an ordered set of statements, living between an opening `{`, and a closing `}`.\n\n Given that it's an expression it has a Type. The type is the value of the last expression in the block, if it's not closed by a `;`. If the last statement is termintat thusly, then the value is `[Empty]`, or `()`.\n\nThe `bug` attribute is there to force the compiler to generate code. Apparently there's some bug in grace that's causing this to be generated as a const. I don't want to get into it, and this is the most expedient solution.",

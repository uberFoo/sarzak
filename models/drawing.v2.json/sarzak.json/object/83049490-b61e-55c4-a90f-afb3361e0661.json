    "description": "An attachment point for an [Anchor]\n\nIt’s used with [Anchor] to orient the arrows on the ends of the lines according to the side of the box to which they are attached. Some arrows are on top, some bottom, etc.\n\nThis is not rendered as a visible item. The [ObjectUI] manages that by itself. This instead renders an invisible line. The line is used for several things. For one, when hovered over the cursor changes to the appropriate one for resizing.\n\nAlso, this is used to register where relationship may anchor.\n\nIt’s this last regard that is somewhat concerning. Indicating that an anchor is attached to an edge get’s us the connection we need between an [Object] and a [Relationship]. But it’s under-specified. It doesn’t indicate where along the edge the arrow is connected.\n\nI’m considering put a relationship back between [Anchor] and [Point].",

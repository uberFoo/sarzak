    "description": "An anchor, or anchor point, is the location where an arrow from a relationship attached to an object.\n\nRather than storing the `x` and `y` coordinates of where the anchor attaches, we are related to an [Edge], which is related to a box, which is related to the [Object] to which we are attached. This of course completes the circuit from the [Relationship] for which we are drawing the lines in the first place.\n\nAnchor also contains a direction, so that we know the orientation to draw the arrows. Finally, there is an offset, which is a point that describes the offset from the anchor for the relationship phrase.",

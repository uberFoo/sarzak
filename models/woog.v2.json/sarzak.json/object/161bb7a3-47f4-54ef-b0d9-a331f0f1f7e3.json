    "description": "Method\n\nThis represents a function's signature. We don't (yet) care about the body of the function. We are however very interested in it's type, which implies parameters and their types, as well as our return type. \n\nLooking at this more closely, I think that this should be related to a parameter list, and the list related to the string of parameters. It may just be a nit, but it does bother me a bit. I'll come back and fix it once it's less troublesome to generate this domain.\n\nThe function in question is a method, hanging off of an [`Object`][o].\n\n[o][damn, now I need a documentation server].",

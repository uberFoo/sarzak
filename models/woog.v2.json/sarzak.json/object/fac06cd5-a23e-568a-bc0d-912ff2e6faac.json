    "description": "A Value\n\nI consider a value as an abstraction for a chunk of memory. By upgrading some bytes to a `Value` you gain meaning and utility.\n\nThe meaning comes from assigning type information to the ones and zeros. From a modeling perspective it is good enough to think in terms of [`Type`], which is just a general hint about the domain of the value. When we get to generating code we require lower level information, which is why we have [`GraceType`].\n\nThe utility are completely compiler/language level constructs. These are [`Mutability`] and [`Visibility`].",
